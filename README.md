# time-series-framework-review

* It is suggested by the domain experts that any types of modeling and prediction should start with a basic proven model. After that we should introduce complexity into the model architechure. Time series is also requires the same approach. In the file section `time-series-framework-review.ipynb` file lists some deep learning approaches, but starts with standard ARIMA process and then progress to the DNN architechures. Although The file mostly consists of univarite examples, I also tried to include few examples from the multivariate time series. All the codes are inspired from a book called 
    
    * `Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting by Jason Brownlee`.
    * For mathematical understanding zou can look at a class note tought at University of Pittsburg `Time Series: Autoregressive models
AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA`
    * For detailed understanding and mathematical expressions you can go through the book `Forecasting- Principles & Practice - Rob J Hyndman`
    * For DNN terms and explanations, you can go through any deep learning book ( I would recommend [Deep Learning textbook, MIT by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, this book is completely free to read online](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/))

* As I am currently reading the book,I hope I could also update the file time to time.
