# time-series-framework-review

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is suggested by the domain experts that any types of modeling and prediction should start with a basic proven model. After that we should introduce complexity into the model architechure. Time series is also requires the same approach. In the file section `time-series-framework-review.ipynb` file lists some deep learning approaches, but starts with standard ARIMA process and then progress to the DNN architechures. Although The file mostly consists of univarite examples, I also tried to include few examples from the multivariate time series. All the codes are inspired from a book called `Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting by Jason Brownlee`.
